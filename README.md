- Speak your response and Luna will reply, creating a natural conversation flow
- A subtle indicator shows when the mic is listening

### Dark Mode

- Toggle the switch in the top-right corner to switch between light and dark themes
- The 3D heart and environment adapt to the selected theme

## Troubleshooting

### Port Issues

- If you see "Port 5000 is already in use" but the app isn't running:
  - The script will attempt to automatically free the port
  - You'll be prompted whether to continue if automatic freeing fails
  - Try restarting your computer if persistent issues occur
  - You can manually kill processes using port 5000 with Task Manager (Windows) or Activity Monitor (Mac)

### Voice Input Issues

- Ensure you've granted microphone permissions in your browser
- Try different browsers if voice input isn't working (Chrome has best support)
- Check that your microphone is working properly and not muted
- If auto-mic mode isn't working correctly, try toggling it off and on again

### Voice Output Issues

- Make sure your speakers are on and volume is up
- Some browsers have limited voice synthesis capability - try Chrome for best results

### API Key Issues

- If you see errors about the Gemini API, make sure your API key is valid and has proper permissions
- Ensure your API key has access to the Gemini model being used

### Connection Problems

- If the application crashes on restart, the script now handles this gracefully
- The port conflict resolution should prevent most restart issues
- Check your internet connection if experiencing API timeout issues
